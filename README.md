LawnTent

Because I can't resist reinventing the wheel.

# What Is This?

LawnTent is (will be) a content management that produces JSON output rather than an actual website.

# Why Built Another Content Management System?

I often want a web-based way to write posts/content with a customizable template of fields but not be tied to a page generator/theme system like WordPress where I end up fighting the system to get things looking the way I want. For a while I was using WordPress to write content and a library to access the WordPress database directly to render things. This is how [mountsaintawesome.com](http://mountsaintawesome.com) is built but that seemed dumb and I had use a kind of hacky system to associate comics with posts.

Besides, it might be fun to build.
